# olMEGA_DataExtraction #

Matlab tool for automatic data extraction (and analysis) from smartphone.  
Version 2.0 

### Prerequisites: ###
* Matlab 2018b (or later)
* ADB (if used with smartphone)

### Usage: ###  

* Graphical User Interface:

```matlab
olMEGA_DataExtraction()
```


### For IHAB study only: ###

* Command Line:

```matlab
[obj] = olMEGA_DataExtraction([Path to data folder]);
```

* or in case of olMEGA_DataExtraction:

```matlab
[obj] = olMEGA_DataExtraction([Path to data folder], [#EMA run]);
```

* For complete analysis and PDF outptut:

```matlab
[obj].analyseData();
```

ICA_DataAnalysis

* For information on Device Parameters and/or objective Data, use:

```matlab
[obj].stAnalysis
```

### Own Voice Detection (OVD):
* Command Line:

```matlab
[vPredictedOVS, vTime] = detectOwnVoiceRandomForest(obj, [struct with time info]);
```
The folder `olMEGA_DataExtraction` contains the subfolders `functions_application > evaluation`.
The folder `evaluation` contains the function `detectOwnVoiceRandomForest` and its test-script `detectOwnVoiceRandomForestTest`.
For a simple test adjust `detectOwnVoiceRandomForestTest`:

1. `szBaseDir`: customize the path to your main data folder

2. `szCurrentFolder`: choose the name of one subject folder (e.g. SF170777_210720_SF)

3. `stDate`: adjust time informations for prediction: start and end day as datetime and start and end time as duration

 â€¦ and run. The function `detectOwnVoiceRandomForest` returns the vector `vPredictedOVS` containing the predicted OVS (1 = OVS, 0 = no OVS) and the corresponding time vector `vTime`.

The OVD calls a feature extraction, which processes data in 1 hour intervals and can take a while, if a longer time period is chosen. We recommend to call `detectOwnVoiceRandomForest` per day.
If for the given input day and time no feature files exist, a short warning occurs and `vPredictedOVS` and `vTime` are empty.
